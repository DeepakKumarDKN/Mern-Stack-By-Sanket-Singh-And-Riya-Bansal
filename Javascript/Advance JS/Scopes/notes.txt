Mainly we have four pillars:
------------------------------
Scopes and closures 
Coercion and types.
Async Programming
Objects and classes.

Scopes:
--------
In javascript we use the scope concept to figure out where a variable or a function is accessible/ visible.
so now lets understand how excatly the scoping mechanisim in JS works.?

and to get to know about the scoping mechanism first of all we need to have some idea about 
compilation and interpetation in programming languages. 

Most of the languages are divided into two languages. 
1. Compilation language. 
2. Interpreted language. 

so what about javascript is it a complied or a interpreted language.?

Compiled Languages:
---------------------
Example of compiled languages are C, C++ etc, to run to code of a complied language we need 
another software called compiler. 

Complier takes the whole code and analyses it and at the end it give us an executible binary,
but if there is any single error then nothing will be added to the executable infact no exeutable will 
be made and it will throw an error which are present in the code. 

If not a single error is found in that case we get an executable binary file.

Intresting fact is all the errors are told at once. 
if lets say the first 100 line of code are correct and the 101 line has an issue
still nothing will be executed.

Hybrid Languages:
------------------
There is a kind of third category type of languages which uses both compiltaion and interpretation
for the                                   final execurion of code. Example Java, JS, Python

Inpreted Languages:
-------------------
Pure inperpreted languages exists for example bash. 
These are those languages which execute our code directly without reading/ analysing the whole code
as soon as it detects any error the moment we detect any error it stops

esks matlab jabtak error nahi milta hai tab tak execute hoga and jab milega tab stop ho jaega.
