Basic Datatypes and Codtionals:
--------------------------------
Javascript is a programming Language. 
    capability to make decessions.
    simply do task repetetions

Variables:
-----------
To store data in our JS Code we can use something called as variables.
variables are kind of buckets where we can store something.
aggar ham js program mein ek variable banate hein eska matlab woh 
memory mein bucket banaega or us bucket ke andar ham data ko store kar paenge. 

es bucket, jo ki hamara data store karta hai esiko kehte hein ham variables.

har bucket ka apna ek name hota hai or usko ham bolte hai variable name.
aur es variable name ko use karke ham kisi bhi bucket ko uniquely identify kar sakhte hein.
modify kar sakhte hein, data add kar paenge, and us bucket se data ko fetch bhi kar paenge.


How to Declare a variable:
--------------------------
Thereare three ways to declare a variable: 
1. var
2. let
3. const

let name = "deepak 
var email = 'deepak@gmail.com"
const fullname = "deepak kumar nayak"

Exaplanation for let var and const. 
-----------------------------------
var firstName = "deepak"
i can also change the value of firstName just by simply writtng: 
no need of writing again [var firstname] because here i just only want to change the value which 
i can do it only by writting 

// change the value
firstName = "rahul"

console.log(firstName) => rahul (now firstname is pointing towards rahul)

After declaring and initializing value to it i can also redeclare it again with same variable name: 
var firstName = "deepak"
var firstName = "rahul"

console.log(firstName)
i will not get any kind of error here as i have tried it with var.


let keyword:
------------
I can also declare a variable using let keyword but there is catch it is diffrent from var. 
let userName = "deepak"


let username = "deepak" => not allowed to redeclare it again.

once it is declare i cannot redeclare it using the same variable(userName)
i will get and error that userName has already been declared but i can do the same thing with var
because there i will not get an error (SyntaxError that the identifier userName has alrteady been declared). 

. So i cannot redeclare using the same value but i can reinitialize a new value to it and can
change its value.

let userName = "deepak"
userName = "rahul"
console.log(userName) => rahul

const keywoard:
----------------
const ko use karke ham variable declare kar sakhte hai. but ek bar declare ho gaya ham esko
na dubara declare kar sakhte hain aur na hi dubara re-initialize kar paenge so const let se thoda
bahut allag hai. 

let username; => kuch na kuch assign karna hi padega aise esko khali nahi chod sakhte.
aggar aise bina assign kiya chod diya toh hame error milega

SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

aur aggar value assign karne ke baad usko change karne ki kosish ki tab bhi hame error hi milega
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

so hai na thda bahut intresting var se allag hai let aur let se allag hai const. 
let and const are block scope esko ham baad mein padhenge.

Datatypes:
-----------
datatypes defines the classification of diffrent type of values we can store in our program
diffrent datatypes:
--------------------
number, string, undefined, boolean, 

Rules for naming a variable:
-------------------------------
. variable name can contain english alphabets, digits, underscore and dollar no other character can be used. 
. variable name cannot start with a digit, starting digit se nahi ho sakhta hai but beech mein ham use kar sakhte hein.
. variable names are case sensitive (for example if you have a variable name money you have to access it using money not Money)
. we cannot use a keyword for a variable name
. keywoard are the reserve words which have some difrent and specefic meaning for example 
    let keyword we cannot use keyword as a variable kyun ki javascript ne let ko kisi specefic 
    purpose ke liye rakha hua hai.
. it better to start a variable name with small letter we can also use camelCase(combination of small and capital letter)
    let userName = "deepak"
